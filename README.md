# Communication Protocols Lab
This project applies what we have learned in the communcation protocols lab (whose documentation could be found [here](https://github.com/Mahmoud-Ibrahim-93/Communication-between-2-Microcontrollers)).
## Used Microcontrollers
We will use two ATmega32 microcontrollers for this project.
## Implemented Protocols
We aim to implement two protocols: **SPI** and **I2C**
## Dependencies
There are no dependencies. However, the project was built using the PlatformIO IDE. Its extension must be installed in order to properly interact with the project on VSCode.
